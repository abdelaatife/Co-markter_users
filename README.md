## Introduction 

Running a business is tricky as there are a lot of things to consider such as building trust and credibility, attracting customers, and creating an online presence. However, one of the most challenging aspects of running a business is to define the targeted audience, their purchasing power as well as their interests while keeping an eye on your competitors. Studying the market and especially your competitor’s development will allow you to be ahead of the competition. Why? Simply because you will have the potential to avoid mistakes and even when you make them you will be able to overcome them, which will lead to better sales and reduced losses. 

Our goal is to help every business owner to grow his business and for that reason, we have developed two applications using flutter and firebase. One application is for business owners or anyone who wants to market his products. While the second one is for the customers so they can stay tuned with their favorite stores.
